# difference between worker MPM & event MPM

The `worker` and `event` Multi-Processing Modules (MPMs) are two different methods that Apache HTTP Server uses to handle concurrent requests. Understanding the differences between them is crucial for optimizing your web server's performance based on the specific requirements of your application. Here is a detailed comparison between `worker` and `event` MPMs:

## Worker MPM

### Overview
The `worker` MPM uses multiple threads to handle multiple requests. It combines multi-threading and multi-process techniques to achieve concurrency, making it more efficient than the older `prefork` MPM, especially for high-traffic websites.

### Features
1. **Multi-threaded Workers**: Each process under the `worker` MPM can handle multiple threads, and each thread handles one connection.
2. **Reduced Memory Usage**: Because threads share the same memory space, the `worker` MPM uses less memory than `prefork`, which uses separate memory spaces for each process.
3. **Scalability**: Better scalability compared to `prefork` because it can handle more connections with fewer system resources.

### Configuration Example
```apache
<IfModule mpm_worker_module>
    StartServers             2
    MinSpareThreads         25
    MaxSpareThreads         75
    ThreadLimit             64
    ThreadsPerChild         25
    MaxRequestWorkers      150
    MaxConnectionsPerChild   0
</IfModule>
```

### Use Cases
- Suitable for applications where memory usage is a concern.
- Efficient for serving static content.
- Good for websites with a high number of simultaneous connections but relatively low I/O operations per request.

## Event MPM

### Overview
The `event` MPM builds on the `worker` MPM's multi-threaded model but introduces asynchronous handling of keep-alive connections. This helps in managing idle connections more efficiently.

### Features
1. **Asynchronous Connection Handling**: The `event` MPM can handle keep-alive connections asynchronously, which means threads are freed up to handle new requests instead of being tied up with idle keep-alive connections.
2. **Improved Scalability**: By freeing up threads that would otherwise be waiting on keep-alive connections, the `event` MPM can handle more concurrent connections.
3. **Low Latency**: Reduces latency for high-traffic websites where many connections are in a keep-alive state.

### Configuration Example
```apache
<IfModule mpm_event_module>
    StartServers             2
    MinSpareThreads         25
    MaxSpareThreads         75
    ThreadLimit             64
    ThreadsPerChild         25
    MaxRequestWorkers      150
    MaxConnectionsPerChild   0
</IfModule>
```

### Use Cases
- Best for high-traffic websites with many simultaneous connections, especially where many of these connections are idle (e.g., waiting for user interaction).
- Suitable for dynamic content served with keep-alive connections enabled.
- Ideal for real-time applications requiring low latency and high concurrency.

## Key Differences

1. **Connection Handling**:
   - **Worker MPM**: Each thread handles one connection at a time, which can be inefficient for keep-alive connections as threads remain occupied.
   - **Event MPM**: Uses asynchronous handling for keep-alive connections, freeing up threads to handle new requests, which enhances performance under high concurrency.

2. **Efficiency**:
   - **Worker MPM**: More efficient than `prefork` but can still be limited by keep-alive connections tying up threads.
   - **Event MPM**: More efficient under high load, especially with many keep-alive connections, due to its ability to handle connections asynchronously.

3. **Performance**:
   - **Worker MPM**: Performs well under moderate load with a mix of static and dynamic content.
   - **Event MPM**: Performs better under high load with many concurrent connections, particularly useful for modern web applications with heavy use of AJAX and long-polling.

## Summary
Both `worker` and `event` MPMs are suitable for handling high-traffic websites, but the `event` MPM generally provides better performance and 
scalability for modern web applications with many concurrent and idle connections. 
The choice between `worker` and `event` MPM should be based on your specific application's requirements and the nature of the traffic it handles.
